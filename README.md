# Beamer template following the W&M Styleguide
There is currently only one version, the default W&M one.  To use, copy the
contents of that directory to the base of your presentation directory.

Alternatively, you can change your environmental variables to point to that
directory.

## Requires LuaLaTeX compiler
Due to the fact that LuaLaTeX just handles TTF font files so much better, I
made it a requirement.  I may fix it in the future so it does not require this.

## W&M Images
I provide lower resolution (rasterized) images suitable for presentations.
Higher resolution images suitable for things like posters may be aquired from
the W&M Auxiliary Services. This can be done on their website which may require
an active W&M username and password: http://styleguide.wm.edu/downloads
